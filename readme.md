HR Dashboard - Power BI Case Study üìä
Overview üè¢

In this Power BI case study, you will be exploring a dataset for a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. The primary goal of this case study is to analyze and visualize the organization's HR data, with a secondary focus on understanding factors affecting employee attrition. This analysis will help the company improve retention strategies and gain deeper insights into their workforce.
Project Objectives üéØ

The core goal of this project is to:

    Build a report to help Atlas Labs' HR team monitor key employee metrics.
    Analyze employee attrition and identify the factors affecting it.
    Create an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard to communicate the findings.

Data Preparation üßë‚Äçüíª

The dataset consists of the following tables:

    DimEducationLevel: Education levels of employees.
    DimEmployee: Employee details including hire date, age, gender, department, and job role.
    DimPerformanceRating: Employee performance ratings.
    DimSatisfactionLevel: Employee satisfaction levels (e.g., job, environment, work-life balance).
    FactPerformanceRating: Performance-related data.

Steps Involved:

    Data Cleaning and Transformation using Power Query.

    Date Table Creation:
        A custom DimDate table was created to facilitate time-based analysis, providing fields like year, month, quarter, fiscal year, and week.
        The following DAX formula was used to create the DimDate table:

    DimDate = 
    VAR _minYear = YEAR(MIN(DimEmployee[HireDate]))
    VAR _maxYear = YEAR(MAX(DimEmployee[HireDate]))
    VAR _fiscalStart = 4 

    RETURN
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        CALENDAR(DATE(_minYear,1,1), DATE(_maxYear,12,31)),
        "Year", YEAR([Date]),
        "Year Start", DATE(YEAR([Date]),1,1),
        "YearEnd", DATE(YEAR([Date]),12,31),
        "MonthNumber", MONTH([Date]),
        "MonthStart", DATE(YEAR([Date]), MONTH([Date]), 1),
        "MonthEnd", EOMONTH([Date], 0),
        ...
    )

    Table Relationships were set up to link the relevant dimensions to the fact tables.
