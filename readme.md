# Atlas Labs Employee Attrition Analysis - Power BI Report

## Overview

The core goal of this case study is to build an interactive report using fictitious datasets from a tech company called **Atlas Labs**. The HR team at Atlas Labs wants to monitor key metrics related to employees and, as a secondary goal, understand the factors affecting employee attrition.

## Data Preparation

The project involves four primary tables:

1. **DimEducationLevel**: Contains data related to employees' education levels.
2. **DimEmployee**: Contains employee data, including personal details, hire dates, and attrition status.
3. **DimRatingLevel**: Contains rating levels for performance and satisfaction.
4. **FactPerformanceRating**: Contains performance ratings such as job satisfaction, environmental satisfaction, and manager ratings.

These tables were renamed with the **Dim** prefix for dimension tables, and the **FactPerformanceRating** table was designated as the fact table. Additionally, a **DimDate** table was created to support time-based analysis.

### DimDate Table Code

```dax
DimDate = 
VAR _minYear = YEAR(MIN(DimEmployee[HireDate]))
VAR _maxYear = YEAR(MAX(DimEmployee[HireDate]))
VAR _fiscalStart = 4 

RETURN
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDAR(DATE(_minYear,1,1), DATE(_maxYear,12,31)),
    "Year", YEAR([Date]),
    "Year Start", DATE(YEAR([Date]), 1, 1),
    "YearEnd", DATE(YEAR([Date]), 12, 31),
    "MonthNumber", MONTH([Date]),
    "MonthStart", DATE(YEAR([Date]), MONTH([Date]), 1),
    "MonthEnd", EOMONTH([Date], 0),
    "DaysInMonth", DATEDIFF(DATE(YEAR([Date]), MONTH([Date]), 1), EOMONTH([Date], 0), DAY) + 1,
    "YearMonthNumber", INT(FORMAT([Date],"YYYYMM")),
    "YearMonthName", FORMAT([Date],"YYYY-MMM"),
    "DayNumber", DAY([Date]),
    "DayName", FORMAT([Date],"DDDD"),
    "DayNameShort", FORMAT([Date],"DDD"),
    "DayOfWeek", WEEKDAY([Date]),
    "MonthName", FORMAT([Date],"MMMM"),
    "MonthNameShort", FORMAT([Date],"MMM"),
    "Quarter", QUARTER([Date]),
    "QuarterName", "Q"&FORMAT([Date],"Q"),
    "YearQuarterNumber", INT(FORMAT([Date],"YYYYQ")),
    "YearQuarterName", FORMAT([Date],"YYYY") & " Q" & FORMAT([Date],"Q"),
    "QuarterStart", DATE(YEAR([Date]), (QUARTER([Date])*3)-2, 1),
    "QuarterEnd", EOMONTH(DATE(YEAR([Date]), QUARTER([Date])*3, 1), 0),
    "WeekNumber", WEEKNUM([Date]),
    "WeekStart", [Date] - WEEKDAY([Date]) + 1,
    "WeekEnd", [Date] + 7 - WEEKDAY([Date]),
    "FiscalYear", IF(_fiscalStart = 1, YEAR([Date]), YEAR([Date]) + QUOTIENT(MONTH([Date]) + (13 - _fiscalStart), 13)),
    "FiscalQuarter", QUARTER(DATE(YEAR([Date]), MOD(MONTH([Date]) + (13 - _fiscalStart) - 1, 12) + 1, 1)),
    "FiscalMonth", MOD(MONTH([Date]) + (13 - _fiscalStart) - 1, 12) + 1
)

Data Exploration

The Overview page visualizes key metrics, including:

    Employee Count Card: Displays the total number of employees (active and inactive).
    Active Employees by Department: Column chart showing the distribution of active employees across departments.
    Attrition Rate: Bar chart visualizing attrition rates across departments and roles.
    Employee Hiring Trend: Line chart showing employee trends over the years, with attrition status as a legend.

DAX Measures

The following DAX measures were created to assess employee performance, satisfaction, and attrition:
% Attrition Rate

% Attrition Rate = DIVIDE([Inactive Employees], [Active Employees] + [Inactive Employees], 0)

This measure calculates the percentage of employees who have left the company.
Active Employees

Active Employees = COUNTROWS(FILTER(DimEmployee, DimEmployee[Attrition] = "No"))

Counts the number of currently active employees.
Average Salary

Average Salary = AVERAGE(DimEmployee[Salary])

Provides the average salary across all employees.
Environment Satisfaction

Environment Satisfaction = CALCULATE(MAX(FactPerformanceRating[EnvironmentSatisfaction]), USERELATIONSHIP(FactPerformanceRating[EnvironmentSatisfaction], DimSatisfiedLevel[SatisfactionLevel]))

Measures the maximum environmental satisfaction level among employees.
Inactive Employees

Inactive Employees = COUNTROWS(FILTER(DimEmployee, DimEmployee[Attrition] = "Yes"))

Counts the number of employees who have left the organization.

Other measures include Job Satisfaction, Manager Rating, Relationship Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance, and others to assess various employee factors.
Performance Tracker Page

The Performance Tracker page includes:

    Employee Start Date
    Last Review Date
    Next Review Date

NextReviewDate = 
VAR reviewOrHire = 
    IF(MAX(FactPerformanceRating[ReviewDate]) = BLANK(), MAX(DimEmployee[HireDate]), MAX(FactPerformanceRating[ReviewDate]))
RETURN reviewOrHire + 365

A line chart visualizes metrics like Job Satisfaction, Relationship Satisfaction, Self Rating, Environment Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance, and Manager Rating over time (by year). Detailed tables for satisfaction levels and rating details are also included.
